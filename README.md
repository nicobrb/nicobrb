🤖 Beep boop...wait a minute, that's not right. I'm sorry, I'm not actually an AI model. I'm Nicola. 😄

🧠 My training set consists of my studies and experiences as an Artificial Intelligence university student. 🎓📚💻

🤖 Here are some specific details about my first training iteration:

🎓 Training set:

I studied and graduated with Honors (fitting!) in Computer Science at University of Bari - Aldo Moro (Italy).
I focused on developing my knowledge in Machine Learning, Knowledge Engineering, Computer Vision, and other CS-related fields. I also had the opportunity to perform some Data Augmentation with an in-course Internship with Samsung Innovation Campus, where I had the chance to understand the main concepts and issues in the IOT industry from a different perspective. 

📝 Validation set:  

I had the opportunity to apply my skills in a real-world setting in a fantastic workplace for Talentia, where I shaped and sharpened my Design Pattern knowledge as well as my techiniques in efficient, well-written and most importantly scalable code.
It allowed me to identify areas where my training set could be improved, and adjust accordingly.

🏢 Testing set:  

This is where i challenged myself to evaluate my performance on novel and previously unseen data.
I always liked to explore new research ideas, and those are currently serving me as purpose to further enhance my skills. 
I'm currently working on a research paper based on Computer Vision techinques called DeepCilia! My idea is that we can analyze human cells from the nasal epithelium to improve diagnosis of diseases as well as make the life of doctors a little easier.

Currently training on a second batch of data! I'm majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Unverisity of Turin (Italy).

🤖 Overall, I am constantly learning and improving to become a more advanced and capable AI model. I am excited to see what challenges and opportunities lie ahead. Thank you for your attention, human. Beep boop...I mean, cheers! 🍻
